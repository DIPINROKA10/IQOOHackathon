# HealthSphere AI 🫀

**AI-Powered Family Health & Preventive Care Management Platform**
Built from the *CareGraph AI* Product Requirements Document (v1.0) — implemented as a complete, live, working MVP.

> Your family's health history is scattered across generations, hospitals and documents.
> HealthSphere AI brings it together, understands your health journey over time, analyzes
> your medical reports, identifies meaningful trends, and helps you take informed
> preventive-health actions.

## ▶️ Quick start

**Requirements:** Node.js ≥ 18 (built-in `fetch` used for live map data). Zero npm dependencies.

```bash
cd HealthSphere_AI
npm start          # or: node server.js
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Demo login** | `demo@healthsphere.ai` / `demo1234` |
| **Or** | Click "⚡ Try the live demo" on the sign-in screen |

The demo account is pre-loaded with 2 years of realistic data: family history,
37 health metrics (HbA1c 5.4 → 5.7 → 6.0 rising exactly as in the PRD scenario),
processed lab reports, lifestyle logs, care team and emergency contacts.

```bash
npm run reset      # wipe & re-seed demo data
npm test           # run extraction / trends / rules test suites
```

### 📍 How Nearby Care works

1. On open, the browser's native geolocation prompt appears (opt-in; coordinates are
   used only to rank results and are never stored).
2. The server queries the **Overpass API** (OpenStreetMap, no key required) for real
   facilities within ~6 km, classifies them (hospital / clinic / lab / pharmacy /
   emergency), de-duplicates and sorts by distance.
3. Alternatively, search any place by name — geocoded via Nominatim.
4. Results are cached in-memory for 10 minutes per rounded coordinate; type and name
   filters are applied locally so filter changes never hit the network again.
5. If Overpass is unreachable/slow, the app gracefully falls back to a bundled sample
   dataset restricted to facilities within 60 km of the origin (or the nearest city's
   set), clearly badged "Offline sample dataset".

## 🧠 How it works — the Hybrid AI architecture (PRD §10)

HealthSphere deliberately does **not** rely on an LLM. Every request flows through
**Rules + ML-style analytics + explanation layer**, then a **Safety Layer**:

```
HEALTH DATA (profile · family · reports · metrics · logs)
        │
   ┌────┼─────────┐
 Rules │ Analytics│ Explainer
   └────┼─────────┘
        ▼
 RECOMMENDATION ENGINE  →  SAFETY LAYER  →  USER
```

### Model 1 — Document Intelligence (`lib/extraction.js`, `lib/pdftext.js`)
Upload → file validation → text extraction → entity extraction → value normalization →
reference-range evaluation → structured data → plain-language explanation.
- Digital PDFs are parsed with a dependency-free PDF text miner (built on Node's `zlib`).
- ~25 analytes recognized (HbA1c, lipids, CBC, thyroid, kidney, liver, electrolytes…)
  with sex-specific reference bands where applicable.
- Handles `120/80` blood-pressure pairs, unit harmonization (`10^3/µL`, lakhs), multiple
  date formats, lab-name detection.
- **Prompt-injection guard**: instruction-like lines embedded in documents are detected
  and ignored (PRD §15 requirement).
- Photos/scans go through a human-in-the-loop review flow that feeds the same pipeline.

### Model 2 — Health Trend Engine (`lib/trends.js`)
Least-squares slopes per metric, trend classification (increasing/decreasing/stable),
sudden-change detection (≥15% jump between last two readings), z-score anomaly
detection, repeated-abnormal detection and missing-data staleness flags.

### Model 3 — Risk & Recommendation Engine (`lib/rules.js`, `lib/recommend.js`)
Evidence-informed clinical rules combine **family history + age + personal health +
report values + trends + lifestyle** into risk *signals* (never diagnoses), each with a
"Why am I seeing this?" factor list. Maps signals to specialties worth *discussing*
(Endocrinology, Cardiology…) plus an age/sex/family-aware screening checklist.

### Model 4 — Lifestyle AI (`lib/lifestyle.js`)
Mifflin-St Jeor BMR/TDEE estimates, goal-adjusted calorie targets, 4-week progressive
activity plans, 7-day vegetarian/non-veg/vegan meal grids filtered by recorded allergies,
hydration targets derived from body weight, and week-over-week lifestyle insights.

### Safety Layer
Strips diagnostic/prescription language from all AI output, enforces explainability
(no factors → no signal), attaches disclaimers, and frames every action as
*"discuss with a qualified healthcare professional."*

## 🏗 System architecture

```
Browser SPA (vanilla JS, hash router, hand-rolled SVG charts — no CDNs)
   │ REST + cookie sessions
Node HTTP server (server.js)  ── lib/api.js route table (~40 endpoints)
   │
lib/* services: auth · extraction · trends · rules · recommend ·
                lifestyle · reminders · timeline · hospitals · seed
   │                                    │
   │                                    └── OpenStreetMap (Overpass + Nominatim, optional, keyless)
   │
JSON persistence (data/db.json, atomic writes) + uploads/ storage
```

## 🔒 Security & privacy (PRD §14)

- scrypt-hashed passwords, httpOnly session cookies, same-origin credentials
- Location is opt-in, used transiently for ranking only, never persisted
- Explicit consent toggles (contacts import, location, report sharing, family view) with audit trail
- One-click full data export (JSON) and immediate irreversible account deletion
- Every sensitive access (emergency card, exports, consent changes) is audited

## ☁️ Deploy (Vercel)

`vercel.json` is included; the server detects `process.env.VERCEL` and exports a
serverless handler instead of listening. No environment variables or API keys needed.

## ⚠️ Medical disclaimer

HealthSphere AI organizes and explains health information. It does not diagnose
diseases, prescribe medication, or replace healthcare professionals. Every insight is
informational and encourages professional evaluation.
